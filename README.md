# Light-weight DES (Data encryption standard) algorithm using Verilog
The Data Encryption Standard (DES) is a symmetric key algorithm (which means 
the same key is used for both encryption and the decryption of the data). Although 
its short key length of 56 bits makes it too insecure for applications, it has been 
highly influential in the advancement of cryptography.
